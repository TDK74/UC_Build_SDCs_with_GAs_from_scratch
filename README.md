# Udemy Course: Build self-driving cars with Genetic Algorithms from scratch

### Acknowledgments
The Python code is from the Udemy course "Build self-driving cars with Genetic Algorithms from scratch".

### Description
This repository contains only Python code from my practice after each lesson.  
In addition, several original Python files were lightly customized to enable automatic launch of race tracks, add slight car dispersion at the start and along the track, and introduce a main entry-point file.  
Other tweaks include reduced population size, fewer training rounds, and increased maximum speed limit. Original Python files with the same names with the modified ones are uploaded with suffix _org.  
I highly recommend signing in and enrolling the course for more detailed explanations and theory. It was fun and interesting! ðŸ™‚

### Notes
- However, this repository contains only the raw Python code from my practice sessions, without any additional dependencies or configurations.
- As a result, the code may not work immediately without modifications. Please keep this in mind when running the scripts.
