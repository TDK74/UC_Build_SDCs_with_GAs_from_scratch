### Description
This repository contains only Python code from my practice after each lesson.  
I highly recommend signing in and enrolling the course for more detailed explanations and theory. It was fun and interesting! ðŸ™‚

### Notes
- However, this repository contains only the raw Python code from my practice sessions, without any additional dependencies or configurations.
- As a result, the code may not work immediately without modifications. Please keep this in mind when running the scripts.
